# Rebalance Vault
## idea
  In this project, the goal was to create a system that performs automatic rebalancing between multiple 4626 vaults.

## how
  On a cherche a recuperais le net rate value via l' api de kiln. Avec cette valeur on peut derterminer comment rebalancer nos vault

## what we do
  We tried to retrieve the Net Rate Value via the Kiln API. With this value, we can determine how to rebalance our vaults

 ## what we have
  We failed to create the smart contract to make the exchange between two vaults. The front-end is done. We have the beginning of the bot in Python, which can calculate the ratio.
